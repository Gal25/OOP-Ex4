### Introduction:
This project is an assignment in an Object Oriented Programming course at Ariel University.\
In the project we were asked to design and implement a pokemon game in python.

```bash
What is Pokemon game?

This game demonstrates a directed wighted graph, pokemons and agents.\
This directed weighted graph presents the path of all the game, 
The role of each of the elements is: The graph symbolizes the path of the whole game, the role of the agents is to chase the Pokemon and eat them.\

There are 15 cases in 4 types of different grapgs.\
The conduct of the game is ultimately to eat as many Pokemons as possible in as little movement and time as possible.\
Depending on the amount of Pokemon that agent ate his speed increased. That is, the more Pokemon he eats, the faster his speed will increase (depend on the pokemon value).\
The goal of the whole game is to find the shortest way to get to the Pokemon and catch as many Pokemon as possible.\
